The ALX Maze Game Project

The objective of this project is to develop a maze game where players navigate through a maze using raycasting techniques to create a pseudo-3D effect. Raycasting is a rendering technique used in computer graphics to simulate a 3D environment in a 2D space.

I have always been fascinated by game development. When the opportunity arose to create a maze game using SDL2, C, and raycasting, I dedicated significant time to mastering the necessary skills to bring this project to life.

This project is implemented on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using the gcc compiler, along with the SDL2 and SDL2_image libraries for graphics and input.

Project Context

In the maze game, players can move in all four directions using the W, A, S, and D keys. Players can navigate through the maze, making left or right turns as desired. If a player encounters a wall, they must change direction to proceed. Players can move in multiple directions and rotate simultaneously.

Project Controls

    W: Move forward.
    S: Move backward.
    A: Rotate left.
    D: Rotate right.
    Mouse movement left/right: Adjust view to the left or right.
    M: Disable the map display.
    N: Enable the map display.

Project Directories

    headers: Contains all header files.
    images: Contains all image files.
    maps: Used by the program to output the map layout using data map files.
